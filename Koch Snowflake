 Koch Snowflake

 Description
The Koch Snowflake is a fractal that starts with an equilateral triangle. In each recursive iteration:
1. Each line segment is divided into **three equal parts**.
2. The middle part is replaced with two segments that form an equilateral "bump," creating a smaller triangle pointing outward.
3. The original segment is effectively split into **four segments**, maintaining the same length as the original.

As the recursion proceeds, the number of line segments grows exponentially, and the shape becomes increasingly detailed.

The Recursive Steps
At each level of recursion:
1. Divide a line segment into three equal parts.
2. Rotate and create a new equilateral triangle using the middle segment:
   - Translate the "middle point" upward to form the peak.
   - Rotate the segments to form the new triangle shape.
3. Fill in the middle with two new segments to complete the "bump."

In other words:
- A line segment is replaced with four smaller line segments.
- This is done recursively for every new line segment produced.
